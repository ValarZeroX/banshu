For instance, athletes may have a BMI over 30 due to a higher proportion of muscle mass, without needing to lose weight if their body fat percentage is low. This indicates that BMI is only a rough indicator and cannot fully reflect body composition and health status.",

It also enables comparisons between populations with different upper BMI limits. A BMI prime less than 0.74 classifies a person as underweight; from 0.74 to 1 as normal; greater than 1 as overweight, and greater than 1.2 as obese.",
    "limitations_of_bmi" => "Limitations of BMI",
    "bmi_3" => "Although BMI is a commonly used indicator to assess an individual's overall body weight status, it also has some limitations to consider. BMI primarily reflects total body weight and cannot distinguish between different tissues (such as fat, muscle, and organs). Therefore, individuals with the same BMI may have different levels of body fat. Additionally, BMI does not provide information about fat distribution, such as whether fat tissue is concentrated in the abdomen or limbs. These factors are important and closely related to health status and disease risk.",
    "bmi_4" => "While BMI has been widely used as an indicator of obesity in the past, we now have a clearer understanding of its limitations. Therefore, healthcare professionals typically consider BMI along with other indicators, such as waist circumference, body fat percentage, lifestyle factors, and family medical history, when assessing an individual's health status. This helps to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of an individual's health and develop more tailored health management plans.",
    "body_fat_1" => "In the past, a simple method for assessing obesity was using the Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. While BMI is a commonly used reference, it often overlooks the actual amount of body fat. Therefore, to more accurately assess obesity, it's important to measure body fat percentage in addition to BMI, for a more objective result.",
    "body_fat_2" => "Generally, a body fat percentage exceeding 25% in adult males and 30% in adult females is considered obese, while percentages between 15% and 25% for males, and 20% and 30% for females, are considered normal. However, these figures may vary with age, as body fat percentage tends to increase with age.",
    "body_fat_3" => "Despite the widespread use of BMI, it has its limitations. For example, BMI does not reflect the actual composition of the body, making it difficult to accurately assess individuals with high body weight but low body fat.

Metabolic syndrome significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.",

BMR is typically expressed in calories, which are the minimum calories the body consumes per day.",
    "bmr_2" => "The calculation of BMR is based on various factors, including age, gender, height, weight, and body fat percentage. Generally, BMR is higher in males compared to females, and younger individuals typically have higher BMR than older individuals. Height and weight also influence the calculation of BMR.",
    "bmr_3" => "BMR is crucial for maintaining bodily functions and overall health as it represents the minimum calories required by the body when completely at rest and not engaged in any activity. Understanding one's BMR can help individuals better set health goals and dietary plans, ensuring that their daily calorie intake aligns with their body's needs, thus avoiding overeating or undereating.",
    "bmr_4" => "Moreover, many people combine BMR with Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) to determine the amount of calories they should consume each day.

By increasing muscle mass and weight, basal metabolic rate can be effectively elevated.",
