For instance, athletes may have a BMI over 30 due to a higher proportion of muscle mass, without needing to lose weight if their body fat percentage is low. This indicates that BMI is only a rough indicator and cannot fully reflect body composition and health status.',

    'bmi_3' => 'Although BMI is a commonly used indicator to assess an individual\'s overall body weight status, it also has some limitations to consider. BMI primarily reflects total body weight and cannot distinguish between different tissues (such as fat, muscle, and organs). Therefore, individuals with the same BMI may have different levels of body fat. Additionally, BMI does not provide information about fat distribution, such as whether fat tissue is concentrated in the abdomen or limbs. These factors are important and closely related to health status and disease risk.',
    'bmi_4' => 'While BMI has been widely used as an indicator of obesity in the past, we now have a clearer understanding of its limitations. Therefore, healthcare professionals typically consider BMI along with other indicators, such as waist circumference, body fat percentage, lifestyle factors, and family medical history, when assessing an individual\'s health status. This helps to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of an individual\'s health and develop more tailored health management plans.',
