For instance, athletes may have a BMI over 30 due to a higher proportion of muscle mass, without needing to lose weight if their body fat percentage is low. This indicates that BMI is only a rough indicator and cannot fully reflect body composition and health status.',

It also enables comparisons between populations with different upper BMI limits. A BMI prime less than 0.74 classifies a person as underweight; from 0.74 to 1 as normal; greater than 1 as overweight, and greater than 1.2 as obese.',
    'limitations_of_bmi' => 'Limitations of BMI',
    'bmi_3' => 'Although BMI is a commonly used indicator to assess an individual\'s overall body weight status, it also has some limitations to consider. BMI primarily reflects total body weight and cannot distinguish between different tissues (such as fat, muscle, and organs). Therefore, individuals with the same BMI may have different levels of body fat. Additionally, BMI does not provide information about fat distribution, such as whether fat tissue is concentrated in the abdomen or limbs. These factors are important and closely related to health status and disease risk.',
    'bmi_4' => 'While BMI has been widely used as an indicator of obesity in the past, we now have a clearer understanding of its limitations. Therefore, healthcare professionals typically consider BMI along with other indicators, such as waist circumference, body fat percentage, lifestyle factors, and family medical history, when assessing an individual\'s health status. This helps to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of an individual\'s health and develop more tailored health management plans.',
    'body_fat_1' => 'In the past, a simple method for assessing obesity was using the Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. While BMI is a commonly used reference, it often overlooks the actual amount of body fat. Therefore, to more accurately assess obesity, it\'s important to measure body fat percentage in addition to BMI, for a more objective result.',
    'body_fat_2' => 'Generally, a body fat percentage exceeding 25% in adult males and 30% in adult females is considered obese, while percentages between 15% and 25% for males, and 20% and 30% for females, are considered normal. However, these figures may vary with age, as body fat percentage tends to increase with age.',
    'body_fat_3' => 'Despite the widespread use of BMI, it has its limitations. For example, BMI does not reflect the actual composition of the body, making it difficult to accurately assess individuals with high body weight but low body fat. Therefore, measuring body fat percentage can complement BMI assessments, helping individuals better understand and evaluate their overall health status.',

    'body_fat_7' => 'Metabolic Syndrome: High body fat percentage is often associated with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, abnormal cholesterol levels, and excess abdominal fat. Metabolic syndrome significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.',
    'body_fat_8' => 'Insulin Resistance: Elevated body fat levels can lead to insulin resistance, where the body\'s cells become less responsive to insulin. This can result in high blood sugar levels and eventually type 2 diabetes.',
    'body_fat_9' => 'High Blood Pressure: Excess body fat, particularly visceral fat, can increase blood pressure, leading to hypertension and an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.',
